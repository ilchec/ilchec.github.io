  abstract = "This paper looks at the correlation between the use of an L2 and the amount of lexical material borrowed from it. Our data comes from the highlands of Daghestan. By matching loanword counts with the data on multilingualism, the study quantitatively supports the suggestion that lexical borrowing from a lingua franca is more intense than from other languages in a multilingual repertoire (Brown 1996, 2011). Brown hypothesizes that the importance of lingua francas as lexical donors is linked to the high rate of bilingualism. In our data, knowledge of languages other than lingua franca was high at some locations but did not lead to substantial borrowing. We discuss the social condition of a lingua franca that makes it a likely donor. Among other reasons, it might not be as strongly associated with an ethnic identity as languages used only towards their L1 speakers, and lexical borrowing from it does not threaten anyoneâ€™s identity (cf. Epps 2018, Vaughan 2019)."

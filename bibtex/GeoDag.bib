  abstract = "We study the correlation between phylogenetic and geographic distances for the languages of the Andic branch of the East Caucasian (Nakh-Daghestanian) language family. We find significant correlations for several alternative phylogenies, indicating that geographic distance is a valid predictor of linguistic divergence. We further observe that the classifications based on considerations other than cognacy-based phylogenies show a better fit with the geography, which we interpret as an artefact of the traditional approaches - other than based on lexical similarity - to classification that tend to implicitly include geography and geography-related factors as one basis of genealogical classifications."

  abstract = "This paper looks at the correlation between the use of an L2 and the amount of lexical material borrowed from it. Our data comes from the highlands of Daghestan. By matching loanword counts with the data on multilingualism, the study quantitatively supports the suggestion that lexical borrowing from a lingua franca is more intense than from other languages in a multilingual repertoire (Brown 1996, 2011). Brown hypothesizes that the importance of lingua francas as lexical donors is linked to the high rate of bilingualism. In our data, knowledge of languages other than lingua franca was high at some locations but did not lead to substantial borrowing. We discuss the social condition of a lingua franca that makes it a likely donor. Among other reasons, it might not be as strongly associated with an ethnic identity as languages used only towards their L1 speakers, and lexical borrowing from it does not threaten anyone’s identity (cf. Epps 2018, Vaughan 2019)."

  abstract = "<strong>Aims and Objectives</strong>: We assess whether data on lexical borrowing obtained through field elicitation may point not only to a specific donor language but also to its specific regional variety, and whether these data are a reliable tool for reconstructing unknown historical patterns of interaction between ethnic subgroups.
<br><strong>Methodology</strong>: We use quantitative analysis of the data obtained by loanword probing — elicitations of short word lists from speakers of minority languages — to calculate the amount and source of lexical transfer. We compare the results across several areas with varying degrees of bilingualism and different contact varieties of the donor language to see how this influences our results.
<strong>Data</strong>: The data for this study come from a large-scale field study in Daghestan, with 72 people from 19 villages speaking four languages. Findings: Our method suggests that speech communities clearly indicate one of the regional varieties of Azerbaijani as the donor, depending on the area of data collection. We also observe that the amount of lexical convergence with the donor depends not only on the level of bilingualism observed in the specific village but also on the L1 of this village, suggesting language borders as natural constraint to the spread of lexical borrowing.
<strong>Originality</strong>: The study is novel in that it is fully based on analysis of data on lexical convergence obtained through fieldwork on minority languages and provide quantitative results that can be compared across speech communities in the survey.
<strong>Implications</strong>: We conclude that the method is sensitive enough to trace donorship to specific regional varieties of the donor language. Limitations: Our observations on the relative weight of the degree of bilingualism and language affiliation of a speech community as predictors of the amount of lexical convergence require more data obtained both from other linguistic environment and by different methods."

Excel spreadsheets contain data on language repertoires of several thousand people from highland Daghestan. The database is accessible online (multidagestan.com). We studied the distribution of multilingualism among men and women, and we wrote a paper on the hypothesis that the introduction of compulsory school education was instrumental in the spread of Russian as an L2. We also carried out a statistical validation of data we acquired through indirect interviews, where people described the language repertoire of their deceased relatives.",

  "description" : "This project was designed to develop a tool for the visualization of information about linguistic structures characteristic of Daghestan, based on the available descriptive literature. A number of datasets and chapters on specific features are now available and can be accessed through the website. New datasets are collected by students of the School of Linguistics every year as part of a workshop, as well as by members of the Linguistic Convergence Laboratory. The map visualizations in the atlas show the languages as groups of villages where the languages are spoken. This allows for a more accurate picture of the size and spread of the respective speech communities, which is important to formulate accurate hypotheses about contact phenomena. The atlas can be used for bibliographical research on a particular topic or idiom, and to formulate hypotheses about the distribution of linguistic features. It also allows a wider audience to become familiar with the linguistic diversity of the region.",

  "description" : "The Daghestanian Loans project studies the lexical influence of different languages in Daghestan on a microlevel, i.e. on a level of granularity that is sensitive to the difference between village varieties. Data from the project on multilingualism in Daghestan show that the conditions and the degree of language contact for each village are unique. Our aim is to discover the lexical correlates of these differences. For this purpose, we compiled a shortlist of 160 concepts for cross-linguistic comparison, and developed a method for quick data collection in the field. Using a fixed list of concepts for comparison allows us to find the quantitative correlates of qualitative differences between areas, such as the spread of a certain lingua franca, the presence and degree of contact with particular languages, as well as migratory processes. Collecting data in neighboring villages allows us to show variation between villages on the map, and it reveals the contours of various zones of influence for specific L2s. For example, lexical influence of local Turkic languages (Azerbaijani, Kumyk and Nogai) is found throughout Daghestan. In the south, however, where Azerbaijani served as lingua franca for a long time, this influence is much stronger. In the north of Daghestan bilingualism with Turkic languages was not common, and almost all Turkic borrowings in minor local languages are shared with Avar, a major native language. Turkic influence in the north was thus most likely mediated by Avar. Our first paper (to appear in Language) details how we can detect different zones by comparing lexical samples from villages and major neighboring languages. At the moment our database contains translations of the shortlist in 14 different languages as spoken in 30 different villages in Daghestan and five villages in the Qax region of Azerbaijan. These 35 villages are distributed over five distinct geographical and linguistic areas.The data are available in an online database.",

It is probable that the acoustic features of the sounds that fill ‘identical’ slots in the phonetic inventories of East Caucasian languages (such as ejectives in Archi vs. ejectives in Lak) are slightly but consistently different. The immediate goal is to prove the presence of such differences in a statistically significant way. The ultimate goal, ideally, is to show that the differences are areally distributed (in a macro perspective, e.g. South Daghestan vs. North Daghestan, and in a local perspective, e.g. showing influence of neighbouring languages on different lects of the same language). Accounting for acoustic differences and similarities in areal terms is, as far as we know, a truly innovative research challenge. This project includes annotation of the recorded data, acoustic analysis and collecting more data during future fieldwork.",

The project attempts to verify claims on the hierarchy of arguments in relativization as they are proposed in current syntactic theories",
  "description" : "In Nakh-Daghestanian languages relative clauses are predominantly formed with a participle construction. Even though they can express different aspectual meanings, participles lack any syntactic orientation. There are no syntactic limitations on the target of relativization. The gap in the relative clause can correspond to a core argument, a peripheral participant or even a participant that is not part of the verb’s argument structure. The relativization of facts, places and time is also frequent. A pilot study on relativization targets in several Daghestanian languages revealed that preferences for the relativization of certain arguments differ. It is not apriori clear whether this is due to the counting method used, the particularities of certain corpora, or the grammar of specific languages. Within the project, relativization will be studied on the basis of more substantial corpus data, using a unified markup for relative clauses. Several Nakh-Daghestanian languages will be researched (Agul, Archi, Ingush, Udi and others), as well as other Caucasian languages, which are typologically and/or genetically far removed from Nakh-Daghestanian languages (e.g. Adyghe).

The increased interest in small-scale multilingualism has been boosted by the realization of its significance for reconstructing the social conditions that favoured linguistic diversity in the pre-colonial world. We identify the similarities and differences among situations of such multilingualism, which lay the foundations for a future typology of this kind of language ecology. We study the sources of multilingualism in small-scale societies, with a special focus on the impact of marriage patterns and the language ideologies. The multilingual ecologies of the pre- and postcolonial world are extremely diverse, with many factors playing a role in their constitution. They are also highly endangered, and thus their study is of the utmost urgency.",

  "description" : "The project was started with the aim of investigating non-standard word-order realizations in the variety of Russian spoken in Daghestan, with a special focus on noun phrases with a genitive modifier. Whereas in Standard Russian the neutral word order is “head noun + genitive” (N+Gen), in Daghestanian Russian the opposite word order (Gen+N) is often employed. The first hypothesis is that non-standard word order in such constructions is the result of contact with the speakers’ first languages (East Caucasian and Turkic), which normally display Gen+N order in such phrases. The alternative hypothesis is that Gen+N order is rather a general feature of spoken Russian discourse, in which constructions of this type are also admissible. To verify our hypotheses, we conduct a quantitative  analysis of noun phrases with genitive modifiers based on the Corpus of Russian spoken in Daghestan. The Daghestanian data are compared to data from: a) other contact varieties of spoken Russian, i.e. Bashkir Russian (based on the Corpus of Russian spoken in Bashkortostan) and Chuvash Russian (based on the Corpus of Russian spoken in Chuvashia); b) dialectal varieties of spoken Russian (based on the following corpora: Ustja River Basin Corpus, Corpus of Rogovatka dialect, Corpus of Spiridonova Buda dialect, Corpus of Malinino dialect,Corpus of Opochetsky dialects); and c) standard varieties of spoken Russian (based on the Spoken Subcorpus of the Russian National Corpus and the Corpus of Russian spoken in Zvenigorod).",

Previous research, based on data collected from three villages, cite it as a prominent characteristic of this variety of Russian and explain it by interference with the Nakh-Daghestanian morphological system. Based on a statistical analysis of extensive corpus data, we show that the probability of preposition drop depends on preposition type, phonetic context and the speaker’s fluency in Russian. We propose that the prominence of preposition drop in the speech of Daghestanian highlanders results from an interplay of two factors: a typological tendency for certain spatial and temporal locations to be formally unmarked and incomplete acquisition of the Russian prepositional system.",

  "description" : "Even is a Northern Tungusic language spoken in a number of small communities scattered across northeast Siberia. This dispersed mode of settlement has led to considerable dialectal fragmentation with diversification at the lexical, phonological, morphological, and syntactic level. This diversification can be assumed to be the result of multiple factors: differential retention of ancestral variation, independent innovation, as well as contact with typologically different languages. We want to elucidate the relative impact of these different factors during the differentiation of the dialects, and especially, to what extent language contact played a role. That there would have been some contact in the history of the dialects is indicated by molecular genetic data showing intermarriage of different Even groups with their neighbors. This study focuses on two of the geographically most disparate Even dialects: the westernmost still viable Even dialect, Lamunkhin, spoken in the village of Sebjan-Küöl in Yakutia, and one of the easternmost dialects, namely the Bystraja dialect spoken in Central Kamchatka. Oral corpora for both dialects have already been glossed: with the Lamunkhin corpus comprising around 52,000 words and the Bystraja corpus comprising around 34,000 words. An important prerequisite for answering the question of how these dialects diverged is to establish in what way they differ.<br><br>The study of dialectal differences usually entails categorical differences, i.e. the presence of a feature in one dialect which is absent in another. Often, however, features differ in frequency, having become less prominent in one dialect in the course of its diachronic evolution, or because a form has developed new functions. When working with smaller corpora, the study of dialectal differences through variation in frequency is problematic. An observed difference in frequency might be the result of a speaker’s preference, rather than a feature of the dialect as a whole. In our first publication we proposed a statistical method that allows us to trace differences in frequency while taking into account the ideolectal heterogeneity of the corpora. Further, we plan to elaborate on statistical models that we use as well as to continue with the linguistic interpretation of the differences we find from the point of view of functional divergence, contact situations and the typology of grammaticalization processes.",

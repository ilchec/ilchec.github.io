<h1>Spoken corpora</h1>
<hr />
<p>In the Linguistic Convergence Laboratory we create spoken corpora, collections of spoken language which give users access to audio recordings of texts as well as the written gloss. Audio access allows researchers to study languages at different levels, without having to rely on another’s transcription. It is important for users to understand that the search function for these corpora is made possible by a standardized glossing of texts, so any study of linguistic features in the spoken corpora requires both working with the text and listening to all the examples used.</p>
<p>The Laboratory develops corpora of dialectal, regional, and bilingual speech variations, predominantly of those spoken in rural areas.</p>
<p>An important aspect of the Laboratory’s spoken corpora is the addition of sociolinguistic metadata about the speakers including information about their age, sex, education, place of residency, and command of other languages.</p>
<p>The spoken corpora are developed in cooperation with researchers from other universities and institutes. The Laboratory is open to the development of new resources along the lines of those already released.</p>
<!-- ## Dialectal corpora -->
<!-- Oral corpora of dialectal and regional variants of Russian are developed by the Linguistic Convergence Laboratory in cooperation with dialectologists from the V. V. Vinogradov Institute of Russian Language of the Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg State University, and other universities and institutes. Currently, corpora of northern, southern, and central Russian dialects are accessible. -->
<!-- ## Corpora of bilingual Russian -->
<!-- Oral corpora of bilingual variants of Russian are recordings of interviews with residents of those regions of Russia where Russian is a second language. Research on Russian speech in these regions makes it possible to draw conclusions about the influence of local languages on Russian and about the mastering of a second language. -->
<!-- ## Spoken corpora of minority languages of Russia -->
<!-- Oral corpora of minority languages of Russia are developed by the Linguistic Convergence Laboratory in cooperation with researchers from the Institute of Linguistics and the Institute of Linguistic Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and others. The corpora consist of audio texts with accompanying transcriptions, translations into Russian, and glosses (word-by-word translations with grammatical analysis). -->

<h1>Dictionaries</h1>
<hr />
<p>Dictionaries contain audio and text data from several villages of Daghestan. The wordlists for dictionaries derives primarily from the Jena proposal for a unified comparative lexicon of the languages of Daghestan and intends to cover Swadesh list and Kibrik and Kodzasov’s thesaurus for Daghestanian languages.</p>

<h1>Other projects</h1>
<hr />
<!-- The Linguistic Convergence Laboratory conducts research on Daghestan from linguistic and sociolinguistic perspectives. Daghestan is one of the few multilingual regions of the world where local languages continue to be used in rural localities for everyday activities. Research is conducted on traditional multilingualism among speakers of highland villages, basic lexicon of Nakh-Daghestanian languages, and on language contact at the level of lexical borrowing and at the grammatical level as well. To better understand the dynamics of linguistic diversity in Daghestan the Laboratory digitized population census data from Daghestan from the late 19th to early 20th centuries. -->

<h2>DagSwadesh</h2>
<p>DagSwadesh is a database of Swadesh-100 wordlists from the languages of Daghestan. The main aim of the project is to substantiate lexicostatistical classification of the Nakh-Daghestanian idioms by controlling the provenance of the wordlist at the village level, including using data from reliable sources and collecting new data ourselves.</p>

<h2>Daghestanian loans database</h2>
<p>The database contains results of elicitation of a list of 164 lexical meanings across languages of Daghestan.</p>

<h2>Atlas of multilingualism in Daghestan</h2>
<p>The focus of this project is on multilingual areas. The aim is to get information about the multilingualism of local people, that is, the languages they can speak in addition to their native language.</p>

<div id="typological-atlas-of-the-languages-of-daghestan" class="section level2">
<h2>Typological Atlas of the languages of Daghestan</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to develop a tool for the visualization of information about linguistic structures characteristic of Daghestan. The atlas is based almost exclusively on data from published grammars.</p>

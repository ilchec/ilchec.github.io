<h1>
  Linguistic Convergence Laboratory
</h1>
<p>
 The Laboratory opened in 2017.
 It focuses on processes of convergence in the history of languages,
 i.e. the processes by which common features spread among languages due to contact between their speakers.
 The laboratory aims at modelling processes of convergence and developing tools to study these phenomena using data
 from electronic corpora of spoken language.
